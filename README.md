# Cat Gallery
A simple app that stores and displays photos and information about cats.
Photos can be uploaded to the app or downloaded from [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/).

This is a practice project I challenged myself with to improve my work efficiency, 
and my skills with HaxeFlixel, reactive UI, and API requests.

## Building
If you want to use this source code and build your own version, the steps are simple:

- __First__: Download and install [Haxe](https://haxe.org)

- __Second__: Follow the instructions to [install HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/getting-started/)

- __Third__: On `project.xml` disable the `USE_API` flag by commenting out or deleting the line
```xml
<haxedef name="USE_API">
```

### Note:
This is built with Neko and Windows in mind.
I do not have the means to test on Mac, so Unix builds may not function as expected.
Html5 definitely doesn't work :sweat_smile:

If you have any questions, leave them in the discussions tab
